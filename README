# A very small DB engine written from scratch in Go.

This small database implementation was written as a learning exercise to learn Golang.

It supports creation and insertion commands right now.

Usage: 

./navi -s /path-to-script


# Script format

- Table creation:
    create table_name (col1 col2 col3)

- Insertion
    insert table_name (col1=val1 col2=val2 col3=val3)
