WORK IN PROGRES !!!

# A very small "DB engine" written from scratch in Go.

This small database implementation was written as a learning exercise to learn Golang.

Usage: 

./navi -s /path-to-script


# Script format

- Table creation:
    create table_name (col1 col2 col3)

- Insertion
    insert table_name (val1 val2 val3)
    insert table_name (col1=val1 col2=val2 col3=val3)

# VM 

Inspiration taken from SQLite: https://www.sqlite.org/vdbe.html


# Progress

Front-End:
    (x) Lexer
    (x) Static-analyzer (Needs refinement)

Back-end:
    () Bytecode Generation
    () VM
